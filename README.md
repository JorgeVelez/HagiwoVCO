# Arduino-VDCO
Voltage Controlled Digital Core Multimode Oscillator using Mozzi library on Arduino

Its a digital Oszillator/Voice for the Eurorack Standart, its based on three different modules from HAGIWO Modular, merged into one small 4HP Module, with added CV input too choose the Synthesis Mode and digital Gain CV input, so can be used as VCO+VCA and also gets in the digital clipping range when the voltage on the gain input exceeds 5 Volts!
